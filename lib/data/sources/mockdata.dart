              "Even still, God was willing to rebuild and restore His people. Gilson writes, The day God reaffirmed to them that they were still his chosen people, and he was still their God. That is a joy that could impart strength.” His love leveled them then as it humbles us now, to consider the New Testament sacrifice of God’s only Son for our own personal restoration through salvation."

              "As the writer of Hebrews tells us, God’s Word is “alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart” (Hebrews 4:12). So how do we put that power to work in our lives? Obviously, reading our Bibles is important, but it’s easy to read passively and forget about it as soon as we put it down. We need to get in there and aggressively interact with Scripture, meditate on it, and consider its implications."

              "Memorization is another critical Scriptural discipline. This gets God’s words off the page and into our hearts. But it’s easy for us to memorize Scripture as an intellectual exercise, without letting it touch our will and imagination. Finding new ways to interact with God’s Word helps to break us out of our ruts. For instance, praying Scripture can equip us to think about the Bible as an extension of our relationship with God. As a discipline, praying Scripture can help us see ourselves as more than receivers of Scripture, but participants in God’s story."

              "Many of us have a grandparent with a well-loved Bible. It’s dog-eared from years of reading, and no matter where you open it, you find handwritten notes, prayer requests, highlights, and underlines. This is a form of Bible journaling. Bible journaling is simply about reading your Bible devotionally and taking time to respond to the insights you receive. For many, this means spending time exercising their creativity by responding to God’s Word artistically. If you scroll through Pinterest, you’ll find a lot of gorgeous examples of artistic Bible journaling."

              "Sometimes when you’re talking about scriptural study with new believers, they’re shocked at the idea that someone would write in their Bible. They hear the words “Holy Bible” and worry that writing in the Bible is somehow disrespectful or wrong. While God’s Word is incredibly important to Christians, we don’t worship the Bible. We want to interact with it in a way that it gets inside of us to transform and shape us. If writing in your Bible will do that for you, then by all means, write in your Bible!"
